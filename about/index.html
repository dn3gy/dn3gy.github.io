          <h1>Hi I'm Dion</h1>
          <p>I am a software engineer that currently attends the University of Virginia and I ABSOLUTELY love to learn and develop new programs and applications. Programming to me is like a puzzle that is at first challenging to solve, but once it's completed you feel an urge of satisfaction 
              that no words can describe. I take on any challegene that is thrown at me and never feel the need to give up until I overcome that challegene, whether it be computer science related or not. </p>
          <p>This site was created and launched in 2019, not for the sole purpose of having a personal site, but for the purpose of informing and helping fellow programmers with new attainable knowledge in technology and how to use that acquired knowledge to build something great.</p>
          <p>Things I enjoy doing: programming (no brainer), playing soccer or mostly any other sports, writing on my blog, traveling, going to the gym, etc. </p>
          <p>A lot of my projects and future projects are on <a href="https://github.com/dn3gy">GitHub</a> for those of you who want to see. I also have a <a href="/resume">resum√©</a>. If you want to talk about anything or are looking to work on any cool ideas, <a href="mailto:dn3gy@virginia.edu">send me an email</a> </p>
